I am a postdoc in Dr. Lisa Giocomo's lab at Stanford University studying how medial entorhinal cortex might act as an adaptable substrate to support spatial learning over days. Specifically, I am interested in how organization of spatial information into sequences during task engagement and replay of these sequences during task disengagement might change as learning progresses and might be required for learning.

Previously, I completed my PhD at UCSF in the lab of Dr. Yadong Huang and co-mentored by Dr. Loren Frank. My [thesis work](/research) measured hippocampal sharp-wave ripples as [a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31370-1), as [a readout for input drive as modulated by different interneuron subclasses](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01655-7), and as a marker for epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's model mice (ongoing).

As part of my research, I enjoy [teaching](/teaching) and [mentoring](/service). I specifically direct my time towards [mentoring](/dei) and [creating resources](/resources) and opportunities for marginalized scientists. I previously co-chaired the [2023 Inhibition in the CNS GRS](/grs).

**Recent Updates**

September 2023: I was awarded an NINDS K99/R00 Career Transition Award to complete my postdoctoral studies and start my own lab. I was also selected to be a mentor coach, designing and teaching curriculum on culturally inclusive mentorship for Stanford postdocs.

April 2023: I wrote the first rigor and reproducibility blog post for Community For Rigor on [how to write reproducible methods](https://c4r.io/writing-methods-for-reproducibility/).

February 2023: Kei Masuda's thesis work, _Ketamine evoked disruption of entorhinal and hippocampal spatial maps_, on which I am co-author, is released as a [biRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.05.527227v1).

December 2022: My review with Dr. Lisa Giocomo, _Neural ensembles in navigation: from single cells to population codes_, is published in [Current Opinion in Neurobiology](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1gH1-3Q9h2Aqkv).
