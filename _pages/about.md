I am a postdoc in Dr. Lisa Giocomo's lab at Stanford University studying how sequences and consolidation support spatial learning in the entorhinal cortex. I recently completed my PhD at UCSF in the lab of Dr. Yadong Huang and co-mentored by Dr. Loren Frank. My thesis work measured hippocampal sharp-wave ripples as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, as a readout for input drive as modulated by different interneuron subclasses, and as a marker for epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's model mice.


I created this site to be a more detailed showcase of my work, including projects, seminars, notes, and other materials which you are welcome to use with attribution.

_In June 2020, my last name changed from Jones to Aery Jones._
