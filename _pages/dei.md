## DEI Goals & Philosophy



**My Goals, in my current work and beyond**
* Create an open and inclusive research environment where all voices are heard
* Actively recruit candidates from underrepresented backgrounds
* Create a space for sustained dialogue on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion through dedicated lab meetings and lab culture assessments
* Respect that each person is unique and adapt our mentorship accordingly
* Support the whole person, not just the science, and promote work-life balance
* Celebrate everyoneâ€™s work
* Seek diversity in the papers E read and the speakers E invite
* Recognize and fund all work towards diversity, equity, and inclusion
* Establish expectations and acceptable behavior through a code of conduct
* Maintain transparency and accountability in our efforts

## Current Actions
I wrote [2 tools](https://github.com/emilyasterjones/bioRxiv_speaker_finder) to assist with some of my own [diversity & inclusion goals](/dei/)
1. Speaker finder: given a list of keywords, searches bioRxiv & Pubmed and returns the authors with the most publications that match that keyword
2. Citation overrepresentation tool: given a bibliography, returns which labs, institutions, & journals you cite the most
