## DEI Goals & Philosophy
I have an obligation to elevate scientists (and future scientists) from underrepresented backgrounds - as defined by race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or socioeconomic status - to their next destination in their career journey. I was given these opportunities as a student with many advantages, and I must use those privileges to support and advocate for others without those advantages. As a neuroscientist, I understand how important brain states are to cognitive function; creating spaces in which everyone thrives is critical to do good science. I will pay attention to and make visible discriminatory structures, because you can't fix what you don't acknowledge. I will center underrepresented voices in diversity conversations. I will work to reconstruct exclusive systems as best I can to build an environment in which everyone can participate and is encouraged to do so. I will adapt my mentoring practices to meet trainees where they are. I will celebrate differences as a source of strength. I will make this work transparent by posting it here, seek accountability by asking for feedback from the community, and recognize that work in the acknowledgements below.

**My Goals, in my current work and beyond**
* Create an open and inclusive research environment where all voices are heard
* Actively recruit candidates from underrepresented backgrounds
* Create a space for sustained dialogue on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion through dedicated lab meetings and lab culture assessments
* Respect that each person is unique and adapt our mentorship accordingly
* Support the whole person, not just the science, and promote work-life balance
* Celebrate everyoneâ€™s work
* Seek diversity in the papers I read and the speakers I invite
* Recognize and fund all work towards diversity, equity, and inclusion
* Establish expectations and acceptable behavior through a code of conduct
* Maintain transparency and accountability in our efforts

## Past Actions
* Served on the Association for Women in Computing, 2011-2014
* Mentored a community college intern from an underrepresented background, 2016
* Volunteered at SF Unified high schools and City College SF, 2016-2019
* Volunteered for the Promoting Underrepresented Minority Advancement in Science program at the Gladstone Institutes, 2016-2019
* Contributed to my postdoctoral lab's DEI plan, including drafting its public [diversity statement](https://giocomolab.weebly.com/philosophy.html), 2020
* Contributed to a formal proposal to a national funding agency to create an undergraduate research program for underrepresented minorities, 2020

## Current Actions
Part of increasing diveristy involves identifying lack of representation and seeking to reconstruct the institutions that created it. To help identify this in who you cite, I created a [citation overrepresentation tool](https://github.com/emilyasterjones/bioRxiv_speaker_finder), a Jupyter notebook that takes a bibliography and returns which labs, institutions, & journals you cite the most. This was inspired by a [similar tool](https://github.com/dalejn/cleanBib) which identifies the gender distribution of your citations. To reconstruct the system that created this bias, I encourage everyone to start by doing as I do: remove bias from your literature searches and actively seek out underrepresented voices. For the first part, I recommend subscribing to bioRxiv and 'lower impact' journal tables of contents and using keyword searches in literature searches rather than just citing papers mentioned in reviews. For the second part, I recommend finding scientists through [#BlackinNeuro](https://www.blackinneuro.com/profiles) and [similar lists](/grs/) to follow on Twitter, Pubmed, and ResearchGate. These lists are incredible, though they do put the onus on underrepresented scientists to identify themselves. To try to contribute to that effort, I created a second Jupyter notebook, a [speaker finder tool](https://github.com/emilyasterjones/bioRxiv_speaker_finder) which, given a list of keywords, searches bioRxiv & Pubmed and returns the authors with the most publications that match that keyword, including contact information. It can also optionally estimate the gender and ethnicity of the speakers using APIs, though there are many caveats to this approach, as discussed in the notebook.

I am co-chairing the 2021 Inhibition in the CNS Gordon Research Seminar. My co-chair (Lauren Hewitt) and I have spent much time making the conference as diverse and inclusive as possible, as explained in detail [here](/grs/).

I currently volunteer with [Project Short](https://www.project-short.com/vision.html)

## Future Commitments
* Calling out conferences I attend for lack of [racial diversity](https://twitter.com/EmilyAsterJones/status/1271228741906128896)
* Specifically recruiting underrepresented and first generation undergraduate students to work in the lab
* Opening diversity discussions with an acknowledgement of the [historical and social context in which this work was conducted](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b33424e4b08972957c8dcd/t/5ee1469c8a2566161953b459/1591821981292/Acknowledgement+Statement+for+Website.pdf), including the fact that my work has been conducted on the land of the Ohlone people (UCSF & Stanford) and of the Piscataway & Anacostan peoples (UMD & NIH)

## Acknolwedgements
I welcome all feedback on this statement and any of my DEI work. Please email me, and if you allow it, I will thank you here.
